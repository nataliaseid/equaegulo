                            <p> Full Reforged, translating into 17 languages. this is all a very significant effort. There are tons and tons of particle effects, models, skins even in the base Reign of Chaos / Frozen Throne game. They have to go through every tree, every unit (including neutral units), every building, and remaster everything. The various terrains, the various weather effects. If you open up the WC3 map editor right and just look under "doodads", there's soooo many of them. Crates, corpses, flowers, houses. Was it a patch or was it Grubby streaming on twitch. Some former WC3 pro players (including Grubby) have been invited to a secret event at Blizzard in USA this month. They are not allowed to give information about this yet, but most likely there will be a warcraft related announcement soon. The assumptions go from WC3 remastered, over WC mobile, to WC4. Hype hype? here is a link to wow reddit. (https://redd.it/7xtlzl). Dota 2 ain't DotA (especially not after 6.82 and most certainly not after 6.85/7.00), League is stale and boring and I can't play WC3 DotA anymore without having my eyes burn. Seriously, those graphics did NOT age well. And matchmaking is another thing to deal with and honestly fuck using external clients. Is it too late to seriously As a fan of both and waiting for both releases and waiting to re-play all the campaigns, it would be awesome to get to play the full WC3 story campaign before continuing to Classic, which would be really cool and smooth transition. 
I played roc and tft years ago and loved them. Lately I've been watching grubby on youtube, and got a craving to try it again. Goddam is the campaign good. Ive just finished the human campaign and you forget how well crafted arthas' story is. It's also a very difficult game. I'm trying the whole campaign on hard mode and it really pushes you. You've gotta be dispelling skeletons, finding the perfect army comp, getting those positions just right, and using hero abilities constantly. Hello, I have became pretty concerned about WC3 Reforged, since it's over a half year and the game was supposed to get beta in "early 2019". Yet I haven't heard a single update from Blizzard, so I'm asking if you guys have any info about the current game state, since I cannot find anything about it anywhere. Edit: Ty for answers, I have guessed that there was no info about it but I am glad that you have confirmed So this bug has existed forever. I almost never submit ops on reddit, but this one bugs me. Is it intended that targetting persists on the real hero after they use manta? in dota 1 manta legit made you guess which of 3 heroes was real. In dota 2 if you target before they use manta, it doesn't. Why is that? It's been this way forever and no one ever talks about. Hello community! I want to share with you my work about voice over for characters of any fraction in game. You can hear them when you click on units during the game. Their phrases and jokes. Every video was made for 1 take.Please, help me to share this to Blizzard team. What if they will ask me to help them? This is my dream. Please, help me to make it true. Здравствуйте! Я хочу поделиться с вами моей работой по озвучке персонажей всех фракций в игре Вы можете услышать их, когда. Hi guys/girls I am actually considering buying reforged early so I can play warcraft 3. I saw on yt and other sources that there are loads of custom maps, kind of like age of mythology that you can play online. I really loved that about the game. How is the playerbase on warcraft 3 right now? Could I fit in as a absolute. 
As someone who really liked Warcraft 3, there are a number of things that I was surprised never really made it into vanilla WoW. It's interesting to look in hindsight and see how the hell the developers missed these things. Feel free to add stuff that didn't make it. And speculate why certain things didn't make it into the MMO. 1. Shaman not having bloodlust. HOW? That was their iconic spell 2. Was there is a historical basis for all the zones in vanilla? Except Eras Zombie Invasion do you guys have any RTS game where its is based on eras when upgrading like from stone era to laser.
